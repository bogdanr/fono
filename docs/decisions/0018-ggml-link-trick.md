# ADR 0018 — `ggml` link trick (`--allow-multiple-definition`)

## Status

Accepted 2026-04-27.

## Context

`whisper-rs-sys` and `llama-cpp-sys-2` each statically vendor their
own copy of `ggml`. Linking both into the same ELF — required for the
single-binary outcome of ADR 0005 — produces a `multiple definition of
ggml_*` link error from `ld.bfd` / `ld.gold`. Three approaches were
weighed:

- **Dynamic-link `llama.cpp`** as a private `.so`
  (`plans/closed/2026-04-27-llama-dynamic-link-sota-v1.md`) — gives up
  the single-binary identity, ships a companion file alongside.
- **Shared `ggml`** by patching both sys crates onto a single ggml
  build (`plans/closed/2026-04-27-shared-ggml-static-binary-v1.md`) —
  preserves single-binary but requires forking and tracking two sys
  crates' build systems.
- **Linker flag.** Pass `-Wl,--allow-multiple-definition` and let the
  linker keep one copy of each symbol while discarding the duplicate.

The last is the lightest touch and works because both copies of `ggml`
originate from the same `ggerganov/ggml` upstream and are pinned in
lockstep with their respective parent crates; they are ABI-compatible.

## Decision

Pass `-Wl,--allow-multiple-definition` for the
`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, and
`x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` targets in `.cargo/config.toml:21-28`. Both
crates' `ggml` copies link in; the GNU linker silently keeps one set
and discards the duplicate. macOS (`ld64`) and MSVC's `link.exe`
handle duplicate symbols differently and do not need the flag.

## Verification

- `nm target/release/fono | grep ' [Tt] ggml_init$'` returns exactly
  one entry (per `docs/status.md:286-289`).
- Smoke test `crates/fono/tests/local_backends_coexist.rs` constructs
  a `WhisperLocal` and a `LlamaLocal` in the same process to guard
  against runtime breakage on future sys-crate upgrades.
- Tier-1 integration: every CI workspace build links cleanly with
  the default features (`local-models`, `llama-local`).

## Trade-offs

- **ABI-compatibility burden.** The decision relies on both sys
  crates' vendored ggml staying ABI-compatible. If upstream ggml ever
  forks (e.g. one of the crates pins to a divergent fork), the linker
  will silently pick one set of symbols and the discarded set's
  callers will hit UB. Mitigation: the smoke test guards the obvious
  break; sys-crate upgrades are reviewed for ggml drift in CI.
- **Linker portability.** `lld` and `ld64` currently honour
  `--allow-multiple-definition` the same way as `bfd`/`gold`, but a
  hardened linker could withdraw the flag in the future.

## Rollback path

Plan H — `plans/closed/2026-04-27-shared-ggml-static-binary-v1.md` —
is the documented escape hatch. If the link trick ever fails on a
future linker, drop the duplicate ggml sources and link against a
single shared copy. The plan is preserved in `plans/closed/` for
exactly this reason.

## Surviving artefacts

- `.cargo/config.toml:21-28`
- `docs/status.md:276-310` ("Single-binary local STT + local LLM")
- `crates/fono/tests/local_backends_coexist.rs`
- `plans/closed/2026-04-27-shared-ggml-static-binary-v1.md` (rollback)
